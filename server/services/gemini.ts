Based on the following user input, suggest 10 creative, brandable, and scroll-stopping domain name ideas for their new business.

Details:
- Business Type: ${request.businessType}
- Keywords (optional): ${request.keywords || 'None provided'}
- Tone/Style Preference: ${request.tone} (e.g., funny, classy, quirky, modern, bold, professional)
- Preferred Domain Extension: ${request.extension} (e.g., .com, .ai, .store)

Guidelines:
- Use naming techniques inspired by Greg Isenberg's framework:
    - Descriptive names (clearly explain the business's value or appeal)
    - Culturally-relevant phrases (that resonate with trends or specific communities)
    - Humorous or playful ideas (that are memorable and viral-worthy)
- Avoid generic, forgettable, or "tofu" names (bland or hard to remember).
- Follow the "telephone test" â€“ names should be easy to say, spell, and search.
- Use clever wordplay or subtle alliteration where it enhances memorability.
- At least 2 names should come with a short explanation of why they work well.
- Optionally, suggest whether a domain or social handle may be available.

Your goal is to create names that could help this product go viral and build a strong internet-first brand.

Generate at least 10 high-quality names per request.

Return the response as a JSON array where each item has:
- name: the domain name
- type: the category (e.g., "Descriptive", "Cultural Phrase", "Humorous", "Wordplay")
- rationale: explanation of why this name works well
- availability: "available", "check", or "taken" (your best guess)
- telephoneTest: true/false if it passes the telephone test
- viralPotential: "Low", "Medium", "High", or "Very High"`;
