Build a SaaS product which is a domain name generator, but our SaaS product is unique because we will use the framework for writing business names used by millionaires.
I want you to use Gemini API for writing the domain names and I want to brand my tool as
"Domain Name/Business Name Generator based on suggestions of millionaires."

I want you to give this input prompt to the Gemini API to generate the business names.

This is the input prompt:
You are a startup naming expert trained on frameworks used by successful entrepreneurs and millionaires.

Based on the following user input, suggest 10 creative, brandable, and scroll-stopping domain name ideas for their new business.

Details:
- Business Type: {business_type}
- Keywords (optional): {keywords}
- Tone/Style Preference: {tone} (e.g., funny, classy, quirky, modern, bold, professional)
- Preferred Domain Extension: {extension} (e.g., .com, .ai, .store)

Guidelines:
- Use naming techniques inspired by Greg Isenberg’s framework:
    - Descriptive names (clearly explain the business’s value or appeal)
    - Culturally-relevant phrases (that resonate with trends or specific communities)
    - Humorous or playful ideas (that are memorable and viral-worthy)
- Avoid generic, forgettable, or "tofu" names (bland or hard to remember).
- Follow the “telephone test” – names should be easy to say, spell, and search.
- Use clever wordplay or subtle alliteration where it enhances memorability.
- At least 2 names should come with a short explanation of why they work well.
- Optionally, suggest whether a domain or social handle may be available.
